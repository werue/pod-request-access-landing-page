## My process

### What I learned

During this project, I learned about regular expressions and what they are used for. I also learned a little bit about using rems vs. pixels and how they scaled with accessibility settings.

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

### Useful resources

Both of these resources introduced me to the notation of regular expressions.

- [Example resource 1](https://www.regular-expressions.info/)
- [Example resource 2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_expressions)
